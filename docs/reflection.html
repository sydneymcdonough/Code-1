        <h2>Reflections on Website Development</h2>
        <p> Coming from strictly a Computer Science background I never coded the media side of coding
            but after digit 100 I have learned I really enjoy the front end of coding because I can use my creativity.
            Github and Oxygen started off very confusing with diferent a version of coding than C++ and java,
            but, after playing with it, it became a lot easier to navigate and became a lot more fun to use.

        <p> PSU wordpress although was easier to learn it gave less oppertunities for advanced coding.
            Creating a theme, adding images, and changing colors and fonts was very fun and easy to do.
            It was also easy to copy and paste my already created resume into the website and post on the website.
